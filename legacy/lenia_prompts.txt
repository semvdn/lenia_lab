please have a look at my lenia lab and help me work out the best way to proceed based on the following goals:

i would like to add evolutionary dynamics to create a parameter set that generates organisms that don't just self replicate but in such a way that the lineages end up different after long enough and that this capacity can be used to evolve lineages of cells to exhibit certain characteristics or behaviours based on the environment. 

to do this we need a way to asses the evolvability of a parameter set by looking at a whole lineage of cells. by hand tuning a parameter set to to produce discrete cells and have these cells exhibit self reproduction, we can save a cell and use this parameter set along with the saved cell to seed the simulation. let it run until the cell reproduces then save the two daughter cells and stop the simulation. then use each of the daughter cells to seed a new simulation and do the same thing again. this will create a whole lineage tree of directly related cells. then after a few generation we can perform three comparisons. 1. look at all the cells in the final generation and asses their similarity. How much has the population diversified? 2. look at the cells in the final generation and compare them to the initial cell. How much have the cells in the final generation changed from the initial cell? 3. look at a few full lineages through the tree and asses how gradual the change was. How smoothly did the cells change over the generations?

this way we can asses the evolvability of a parameter set and evolve parameter sets to improve their evolvability. eventually once we have an evolvable set we'd like to try exposing the cell lineages to environmental stresses to incentivise the evolution of certain behaviours (heat avoidance, food seeking, etc.)
to do this we need a mechanism to asses the fitness off an individual cell under a certain environmental pressure.
we also need control over the reproduction to prevent cells from reproducing too early preventing them from experiencing the environment to properly asses the fitness of the cells.
we could maybe achieve this by using a phased training approach by incentivising reproduction only after a set number of frames, by checking when cells divide during the parameter evolution.

once we have these two types of selection we could combine them to create a very robust evolutionary process which finds parameters sets that create evolving cells that are generally adaptable to environmental conditions. 

once we have all of that in place I would like to visualize a few things. I want to visualize the course the evolution took through parameter space. and once we have the evolvable parameters the course of the cell lineage through morphospace while adapting to certain environmental forces.

help me work out the best way to do this with the current setup I have for my lenia simulation laboratory.
